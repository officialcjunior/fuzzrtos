Towards this end, reduced-memory and efficient embedded real-time operating systems (RTOS) are required to process data acquired by such devices. Primarily, RTOS is designed to support IoT devices in diverse applications andoperational requirements on time. FreeRTOS is known as one of the most utilized RTOS in practice. This is becauseit supports numerous processor architectures and its possession by Amazon has driven increased investment in engineering. Nonetheless, FreeRTOS connectivity is limited to Wi-Fi, Ethernet, or Amazon Web Services (AWS)-IoT Core via a mobile device using Bluetooth Low Energy connectivity. This rends the communication’s coverage very short, especially when connecting to the application and network remotely is needed. Motivating by the above, we aim to add new functionality in FreeRTOS AWS allow-ing to support a cellular Service in module Quectel BG96 (e.g. Narrowband (NB)-IoT,2G) able to connect the device to the internet.",0
